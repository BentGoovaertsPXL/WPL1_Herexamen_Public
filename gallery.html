				<summary>Werkplekleren</summary>
				<p></br>Without a doubt the most import class i took on this year, Werkplekleren is dutch for workplace learning and as the name implies it's all about learning how to get a job and keep a job. We were tasked with doing and making many things, this portfolio is one of the projects that i worked on as part of Werkplekleren.</br>Now lets get to what all i got up to during werkplekleren:</br></br></br>Chapter 1: POP-Sessions</br>POP stands for Persoonlijk Ontwikkelings Plan which itself translates to Personal Development Plan or Personal Growth Plan. It's split up into three sections: Feedback & Reflection, Core values & Motivation and Personal Branding. First up is Feedback & Reflection:</br></br>Problem, i no longer have access to what i wrote for this part so i can't copy and paste it. This means i'll have to rewrite it based on memory, fortunately i do remember i had to talk about a time i messed up and reflect on how i could have done better. So let me tell you the tale of how missing my bus stop caused me nothing but grief:</br></br>I was working as a caretaker of children at a vacation camp, what exactly this job entailed doesn't matter. What does matter is that one of the caretakers had to arrive early to work in order to get all the equipment set up, i elected to take on this responsibility for the week because i knew i would like the peace & quiet. On Thursday there was a problem however, i was taking the bus to go to work as usual and partway through my commute i had to get off the bus and onto another one. I pressed the button to make the bus stop at the next bus stop but... it didn't, either the button didn't work or the driver didn't notice. Whatever the reason may be i ended up getting off at the next bus stop, which just so happened to be really far away... just my luck. I needed to get back to take the second bus and so i had a choice to make,</br>do i 1. go back the way the bus drove which i know will lead to the right road and i know will take a while or 2. do i walk in the direction of the road further up ahead to walk a bit in the direction i ultimately need to go. Trusting my skills with cartography and navigation i chose the latter option however it didn't change the fact that it was still a very long walk, after an hour of walking i managed to call my mother who had just woken up. I explained the situation to her and she agreed to come pick me up and drive me to work. Fortunately my colleague had been able to keep things under control while i was away and after that the rest of the day went off without a hitch.</br></br>So what could i have done to prevent this:</br>-Ever since this event i have been taking the bus early so that if i do end up missing a bus or a stop i can wait without being late.</br>-Callout out the driver and telling them i needed to get off might have worked and if nothing else i couldn't hurt.</br>-I definitely should have made sure to have mobile internet during the days i'd work so that if something like this happens i can immediatly contact work and let them know, they likely wont be too happy either way but it's better if i tell them.</br></br></br>The next POP Session is Core Values & Motivation:</br></br>For this the first thing we had to do is fill out a questionare which you can download <a href="Assets\Werkplekleren\MotivationQuestionaire.docx" download="MotivationQuestionaire" id="InTextLink">here.</a> After the questionnare it was another set of questions but this time not in a word document so i will write them out here:</br>1. What makes me happy and/or satisfied.</br>-What was i doing?: Falling through the skies in the video game Gravity Rush 1.</br>-Was is with others, if so who?: I was alone.</br>-Why (and in which way) did this moment mean so much to me?: In Gravity Rush your character has the ability to change the direction of gravity, this means she's not flying through the sky, she's freefalling. It's a more sciency and technical way instead of "Why can superman fly, he just can.".</br>-What made me so happy and/or satisfied, what played a role in this?: When freefalling i can simply shut off the rest of the world and enjoy the serenity, also Hekseville (the world the game takes place in) is one of, in my opnion, the most beautiful places ever.</br></br>2. What makes me proud.</br>-Why was i proud?: I was racing in a game, in this race there were two groups of cars racing simultaneously. I was in the slower group and yet still managed to win the whole race. I was faster than both groups meaning i was able to make a Honda Civic go faster than Dodge Vipers, Lamborghini's, Porsche 911s, etc.</br>-What contributed to this feeling of pride?: I looked it up and the only time in le mans history when a gt car (slower) beat every prototype (faster) was in 1995 by McLaren. I didn't check any other endurance races but either way, i clearly did something quite rare. (even if it was in a game)</br>-Did i share this pride with others, if so who?: No, i accomplished this by myself and i didn't desire for praise from others. I am satisfied with the knowledge that i managed this.</br></br>3. Choose your values.</br>-Go to a website and fill in the survey, note down the "toplist" in order.: 1. Self respect, 2. Respect. 3. Fair treatment</br></br>4. Prioritizing my values.</br>-Look through the list of values we have provided and add two more values to the list in any position.: 1. Acceptance, 2. Authenticity, 3. Self respect, 4. Respect, 5. Fair treatment</br></br>5. Integrity check, review the top 3 and answer these questions.</br>-Am i satisfied with this list of values?: I would like to replace Self respect with Methodical.</br>-Would the people close to me agree with this list?: Nobody close to me has bothered to figure out what kind of person i am, they likely wouldn't agree but also wouldn't disagree.</br>-Do i feel like these 3 values reflect my identity?: They don't reflect my identity so much as they reflect how much i value my identity.</br>-Would i defend these values, no matter what happens?: I am very happy with who i am, i won't let anyone change me but me.</br></br>After all those questions we had to fill out a core quadrant:</br></br></p>
				<img src="Assets\Werkplekleren\CoreQuadrant.png" class="FullImageAlt">
				<p></br></br></br>The final pop session is personal branding:</br></br>Here we were put into groups and then had 1 minute each to present ourselves, while presenting the others would note down keywords that described the person speaking. We then had to take those keywords and put them together with photos of clothing we'd wear to work and a portfolio we like the look of. Here is Mine</br></br></p>

				<p></br></br></br>Chapter 2: Workfield Exploration</br></br>For this companies had send people to talk about their companies and how they operate, we'd then ask them questions we'd prepared. You can view the .txt file containing my notes <a href="Assets\Werkplekleren\QuestionsForSeminars.txt" target="_blank" id="InTextLink">here.</a></br>After this we were tasked with finding a job vacandy posting and noting our thoughts which you can see below:</p>
				<img src="Assets\Werkplekleren\Vacature.jpg" style="position: relative; width: 40%; left: 30%; aspect-ratio: 864/1156;">
				<p></br></br></br>Chapter 3: Dashboard CV</br></br>The first major project, i would form a group with two other students and together we would design a dashboard that highlights all that which we have to offer to potential employers.</br>You'll find mine below but please note that the about section doesn't come off very professionally, this was something i was called out on and i have adjusted myself accordingly. It does not accurately represent who i am in a professional setting.</p>
				<img src="Assets\Werkplekleren\DashboardProfile.png" style="width: 100%;">
				<p></br></br></br>Chapter 4: Portfolio</br></br>The first part was the visual design where we were tasked with creating the appearance of our portfolio in figma. Since the source code for this website is unlocked there's no reason to hide the figma file so <a href="Assets\Werkplekleren\PortfolioVisualDesign.fig" download="PortfolioVisualDesign" id="InTextLink">here it is.</a></br>After that is the portfolio itself which you are currently viewing and the last part is a final endreflection:</br></br><a href="Assets\Werkplekleren\WPLEndReflection.pdf" target="_blank" id="InTextLink">WPLEndReflection.pdf</a></br></br></p>

				<summary>Graphic Skills</summary>
				<p></br>During the two years i've been at this school thus far i've taken on many classes, one of them being "Graphic Skills". In this class we would learn how to use Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator, along with the various techniques you can use to get satisying results. Like all classes at this school instead of regular tests we'd have PEs (Permantente Evaluatie) Which were less frequent but bigger in scale.</br>Below is the first PE we had, the task was to recreate what the teacher showed us using the various assets provided. While the end result was plainly given to us, copying it wasn't so easy because we'd have to figure out which of the many tools Photoshop offers we'd have to use. I'm quite proud of how well i did on this PE especially considering that technically i did better than the teacher, he'd accidentally cut out part of the fingers behind the phone while i didn't.</br></br></p>
				<img src="Assets\GraphicSkills\Y1PE1.png" class="FullImage">
				<p></br></br></br>The second PE was once again a recreation, this time in illustrator, making heavy use of patterns and circular cloning. Although i scored well i'm not too happy with this design, not because i struggled to recreate it but because i find the use of patters to be too obvious. </br>I would have liked it if the pattern on the shirt didn't look like a flat surface but then we'd have to play around with 3D which was too advanced for students of our skill level.</br></br></p>
				<img src="Assets\GraphicSkills\Y1PE2.png" class="FullImage">
				<p></br></br></br>For the second year the PEs stopped being recreations, below is the first one of the year where we were tasked with creating a logo for a made up company that sells electrical bycicle accessories called "Charged". </br>For the first design i simply made what came to mind, this wasn't inspired by anything, i just happened to come up with it. Maybe that's why i like it so much, it's feels more like my own that way. </br>For the second design i figured i'd need one where it's just the brands name. I designed these letters from scratch without using any kind of font. </br>For the third design i figured that Charged might want to have their logo extruded out of the plastic shell of their products, to suit this purpose i designed this logo to be bulky and simple because the machines used for the extrusion are incapable of fine detail.</br></br></p>

				<p></br></br></br>The second PE of the second year tasked us with designing our own font, i decided to make a full alphabet based of the font used by the animator GeoEXE in his series titled "Gwain Saga". The letters in Gwain Saga are all very square so i wished to minimise the use of diagonal lines, the side effect of this is that certain letters such as the B look quite odd and can be mistaken for other letters or numbers.</br>I haven't made this into an actual font as that wasn't part of the PE and currently am far too busy to worry about something that won't help me with school. But i would like to some day, maybe i'll also make a font for the Gravinese alphabet found in the Gravity Rush series of video games.</br></br></p>

				<summary>UI Design</summary>
				<p></br>For UI Design we were put into groups and tasked with making an entire UI for a made up application in Figma, i felt like i was too restricted because i had to base my designs off of what my teammates had made. I think some of the parts they made didn't look very good but had no choice but to use them in my designs also because we couldn't have any inconsistency in the design of our app.</br>This is why i have chosen to instead showcase a smaller project where i was tasked with designing a hero page, all the text and images were already provided and i was forbidden from changing them. The task was to design the rest of the page around what was already there, we were also required to include an animation. The three images shown are the three steps of the animation, it would transition from having the stack of bank cards facing forwards to being at an angle, then it would split the stack showcasing the different colors, lastly it would reverse and go back to step 1.</br></br></p>

				<summary>UX Design</summary>
				<p></br>UX stands for User eXperience which is quite a vague definition, in a way UX covers everything from UI to programming to physical store layouts. For this class however, we focused entirely on researching what clients want. We needed to pick a brand and my group decided to go with the local public transportation network as they had recently overhauled their entire eveything and we thought this would be a great opportunity to document how these changes would affect customer satisfaction.</br></br>I would like to take a moment to vent my frustrations as this was by far the worst group project i've ever had the misfortune of being a part of. It was me and two other students, both of whom seemed to have no intention of working on this project. They rarely ever showed up to class and even when they did they were either on their phone the whole time or in lala land. Everything you see below is my own work, the other two only made their own customer journey and two more profiles each. We also needed to record an interview with people who matched up with the profiles, these recordings cannot be found here as despite how horrible my teammates were, i do still respect their privacy. </br>I can however tell you about these recordings: We sat together and discussed what questions we should ask during our interview, it's important to note that these questions were intentionally made to be simple and not go very deep. This is because we'd agreed that during the interview we'd adjust them on the spot to make the whole interview feel more organic, it was also very important that we'd press the interviewee on each answer they give asking "Why is that?". The importance of this was stressed both during our discussion and by the teacher during the lessons, however when i listended to the recordings my team had sent in all i heard was them asking the questions exactly as they were written. Either they had forgotten everything we discussed or they weren't paying attention.</br>When the deadline for the project came up it still wasn't finished, makes sense considering there's no way i alone could accomplish all that within a time limit that was set assuming you'd have three people working on the project. Fortunately, despite this being a group project, we were still awarded individual scores and i assume the teacher must have known i did basically everything because the despite the incomplete nature of the project i still passed. As for my teammates i do not know and i have no desire to re-establish contact so i can ask them.</br></br></p>

				<summary>Digital Branding</summary>
				<p></br>For Digital Branding me and my group were tasked with choosing an institution from a predetermined list and then designing a brand for it. Early on we ran into trouble when one of our teammates refused to contribute or respond to our inquiries about their lack of contribution. A few weeks later it would become known to us that they were going to drop out of school and because we were alreade weeks into the project, there was no option for reassigning the teams which means two people would have to handle a three man workload.</br>Despite this setback me and the other teammember were able to cooperate quite soundly allowing us to still deliver a satisfying result. You can download our presentation via the link below, it includes market research, brand identity and design prototypes.</br></br></p>

				<summary>Scripting</summary>
				<p></br>In this class me and another student were paired up and tasked with creating a webshop, it would test our knowledge on constants and variables, conditionals, loops, operators, arrays, functions, objects, DOM-manipulation and event handling. There was also a list of things and functionalities the webshop was required to have, these were:</br>-Every product must have an ID, name, description, price and stock.</br>-The webshop must include a homepage, productlist, product detail page, functional basket system, billing page and a contact page.</br>-The webshop must allow users to browse products, review product details, add items to their basket, adjust the quantity of items in the basket, remove items from the basket, complete a transaction and contact the webshop by filling in a form with a name, email address, subject and message.</br>-The webshop must make use of all javascript features we've learned.</br>-The webshop must be made using html, css and javascript, no other frameworks were allowed.</br>-The design of the webshop must be responsive and fit any screen size.</br></br>I let the other student take care of the visual aspect of the webshop while i focused on the backend, of course they would also contribute a bit to the backend because otherwise it wouldn't be a very fair spread of the workload.</br></br></p>

				<summary>Roblox Studio</summary>
				<p></br>Roblox is like YouTube except with games instead of videos, you can go onto Roblox and play games that other users have made or you can make and upload your own. Game design is the number one thing i love most in the world, it's a great way for me to give form to the many ideas in my head. </br>If you've been keeping up with the news or are a Roblox user yourself then you'll know that Roblox regularly mistreats it's users by refusing to listen to our complaints and refusing to keep the platform safe for children, so why then do i use Roblox to make my games. Well, it's because Roblox Studio is the first game engine i ever used, it's the one i'm most familiar with and it's very easy to use which makes realizing my visions all the easier. Roblox Studio won't let you make the most jaw dropping experiences in all of gaming but it will let you relax and have fun. </br>Sometimes i like to just make something, anything and if i like it i keep it for later. In this video i have a collection of some of the various things i've made using Roblox Studio including double jump, dashing and a dynamic water effect.</br></p>
				<video src="Assets\RobloxStudio\GameAssetsTest.mp4" controls></video>
				<p></br></br></br>There's a game on Roblox that i like very much, it's called Notoriety: A PAYDAY® Experience. In this game you play as a crew of heisters robbing banks, jewelry stores, warehouses, etc. Unlike the non-Roblox game Payday 2 which Notoriety is based off, Notoriety doesn't have an explorable safehouse (not as of writing this) so i decided i'd make my own. </br>This isn't official it's just something i made for myself with my own story reasoning as to why the crew stay in these hotels/motels. Aside from interactable lights and bathroom furniture there isn't anything to do besides enjoy the visuals. This is and was always my intention as i merely wanted to make a safehouse according to what i had in mind.</br></br></p>
				<video src="Assets\RobloxStudio\NotorietySafehouse.mp4" controls></video>
				<p></br></br></br>As of writing this i am still working on this project, i've found that all racing games on roblox are terrible and i think i know why. It's because they all have terrible handling models, there's no way you can enjoy playing a racing game if the driving itself feels off. I have some ideas on how to fix this like lowering the games' gravity or dynamically decreasing the steering angle as your speed increases. </br>I'm also using this as an opportunity to just make a whole bunch of cars and tracks to race them on, not show in the video is an F1 car i'm working on, i have plans for a rally car, i was thinking i could make and F-22 Raptor with wheels because why not, i'm currently working on a go-kart track and have plans for a full-scale circuit and a rally stage and i'm sure i'll think of more things as i go along.</br></br>For now tho, let's focus on what is shown in the video: I have made a go-kart with a functioning steering wheel and pedals, the throttle pedal moves when you press the button to go forwards, the steering wheels turns in the direction you do, you get the picture. There's also a backfire system where whenever you let go of either forwards or backwards, the exhaust will spit a bit of flame and make a popping sound. This can easily be applied to any other vehicle and can easily be disabled if you don't like it</br>I'm looking into making your characters arm and legs appear and move the pedals and wheel when you're in first-person but am prioritizing other things first.</br></br>Also please not this footage is of an older build, glaring problems such as the shaking of the wheels when steering have been adressed.</br></br></p>

				<summary>Forza Livery Designer</summary>
				<p></br>Since a very young age i have loved cars, the sound, the speed, the G-forces trying to tear your lungs out, it's a blast! On top of that i also consider cars to play a pivotal role in how we present ourselves, that's likely why i have always been enamoured by good looking cars. So much so that a regular passtime of mine is using the advanced infrastructure found in the Forza games to make some very visually pleasing liveries. Below are some of the ones i am most proud of.</br></br></br></br>First up is my attempt at turning a 2012 Nissan R35 GTR Black Edition into a high-speed rally monster.</br>I was browsing through a local supermarket one day when in the toys section i saw a cheap, crappy remote control car, this thing was borderline garbage and the price reflected that however it did have an unusually detailed livery. Upon seeing this i was inspired and wanted to make something akin to this in Forza. It took a very long time because i would spend weeks if not months trying to come up with how to make this livery look good, i had a rough idea of what i wanted to make but couldn't work out the finer details. Also when i finished it didn't feel quite right yet so after a bit of brainstorming i tried to introduce different materials into the mix. By default every livery is entirely glossy and while you can adjust the shininess of the whole livery, doing so for individual parts was not possible. Not by conventional means thats is, </br>i replaced the blue basepaint with a metallic grey, added the blue back in as part of the livery and converted all grey pieces of the livery to masks, all of this is just a really convoluted way of turning the grey parts of the livery metallic. This gave the whole livery some much needed variety and i love how it turned out. Another difficult problem was the text, Forza does have fonts built in but none of them fit what i had in mind which means i had to manually create each individual letter. This part was without a doubt the most time consuming part.</br></br></p>

				<p></br></br></br>On march 29, 2023 Forza Horizon 5 received a dlc called Rally Adventure allowing player to live out their wildest rallying fantasies. In this dlc there are 3 different teams competing against one another: The Apex Predators, The Horizon Raptors and The Grit Reapers with each team specializing in a particular style of rallying. (asphalt, dirt and night respectively) Now, in the final race of the dlc you have to race against the leaders of all three teams in a massive race around the whole map, such a spectacular race deserves a spectacular car i thought. </br>The game insists that you race in what the game calls a "Rally Monster" and out of all the options i found that the 1978 Hoonigan Escort RS1800 was the best option for me. I decided to make a livery incorporating all the team colors which wasn't particularly hard of course but it looked quite plain, therefore i decided i would add additional graphics in dark grey so there would be very little contrast with the black basepaint, that way these graphics wouldn't draw attention and would stay in the background. </br>Even though the R35 above has more shapes that make up it's livery, this one is definitely the most detailed because every part is a reference to something rather than just stuff that looks cool. Since i used a hoonigan for this livery, just like every other hoonigan car i've used, i also added a tribute to Ken Block the legendary racing driver who tragically passed away on the 2nd of january, 2023. Ken's driver number was 43 so i always add a graphic that reads "43VER" (43 forever). </br></br>R.I.P. Ken Block.</br></br></p>

				<p></br></br></br>Forza Horizon 4 is set in the United Kingdom so it would be a bit silly for me to not make a livery incorporating the union jack however making a mini cooper with a union jack roof was too generic for me. I love Jaguar! If it weren't for the recent rebrand (2024), Jaguar would probably be my favorite car manufacturer in the whole world, so naturally i'm going to use a fast jag for the livery. Having decided that i would apply the flag across the whole body of the car i once again felt that just a regular union jack would be too boring. </br>As it turned out however, it's quite difficult to make a union jack that looks like a union jack without making it look like a union jack. So in the end aside from the color scheme it doesn't really look like the uk flag, in fact i'm sure there's plenty of people who, if i showed them this livery without telling them what it's supposed to be, wouldn't know it's a union jack. It does however still look quite good.</br></br></p>

				<p></br></br></br>Forza Horizon 3 was the first Forza game i ever played, back then tho my livery designing skills were... not good. I would never publicize the designs i made back then because i would die from embarrassment. I do come back to this game sometimes, partially because of nostalgia, partially because some cars are only in this game and partially because i just really like the australian scenery. </br>Making racecar liveries isn't unusual for me and the fact that this is from Forza Horizon 3 isn't really relevant, i just decided to include this specific livery because i'm proud of it. I will confess that this is not an original design, i was watching a youtube video and saw a Lamborghini racecar with this design and decided to recreate it.</br></br></p>
